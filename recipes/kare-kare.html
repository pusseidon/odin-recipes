        <li>Now, get a pan and combine the oil and annatto seeds together. Cook over low heat for 3 minutes or until the color of the oil turn orange. Strain out the seeds then pour the infused oil back into the pan. Throw in the onions and garlic and saute intil lightly toasted. Add the softened oxtail next and continue to saute.</li>
        <li>Just a few more steps and this dish is done. Add the peanut butter, 1 1/2 cups of broth(where oxtail was softened) and Knorr Beef Cubes. Mix well until peanut is dissolved. Simmer for 15-20 minutes until sauce has slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetables last and cook until done. </li>
